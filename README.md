## Setting Up MongoDB

1. **Install MongoDB Compass**  
   Download and install [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass), a GUI for MongoDB.

2. **Create a Database and Cluster**  
   - Open MongoDB Compass.
   - Create a new database named **`CartApp`**.
   - Within this database, create a cluster (collection) also named **`CartApp`**.

3. **Configure Database Connection**  
   - Navigate to the `appsettings.json` file in the backend directory.
   - Locate the `ConnectionStrings` section:
     ```json
     "ConnectionStrings": {
         "MongoDb": "mongodb://localhost:27017/CartApp"
     }
     ```
   - Replace `"mongodb://localhost:27017/CartApp"` with your own MongoDB connection string if it differs.

## Running the Project

### Backend (API Server)
1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the projectâ€™s root directory.
2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

### Frontend (Shopping Cart)
1. Navigate to the `shopping-cart` directory:
   ```bash
   cd CartAPP-MTH404/shopping-cart
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Once the server is running, it will generate a localhost URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). Open this link in your browser to use the application.

---

## Usage

1. Ensure both the backend and frontend are running.
2. Use the frontend link (`http://localhost:3000`) to access the application.
3. Interact with the app to test its features, such as adding items to the shopping cart.

## Notes

- Ensure your MongoDB service is running locally.
- If you encounter any issues with the connection string, double-check your MongoDB setup and adjust the `appsettings.json` file accordingly.
- For any issues with dependencies, use:
  - `npm install` inside the `shopping-cart` folder to install frontend dependencies.
  - `dotnet restore` inside the backend folder to restore .NET dependencies.
